Lyrics:
```

I can't fuck with you crowdy, Oops my bad,I can't fuck with you broski.

Yeah So we on the track can't fuck with no Wishy Wawa.
Designer down to the sock Ohhh, money sing like Wakka Flocka. She'll be ringing down my line, but I don't wanna talka.

I'm getting to the grind. Cash what we bout the Gwalla. Wishy Wawa

Wishy wawa

I can't fuck with you crowdy, I can't fuck with you broski.

We on the block, cash flow we keep it low key.

100 bands to 50 bands she wanna know me.

Its LB shoot like ...

22 up in that clip. Kick like Bruce Lee through that shit.

When we pull up it get lit. Get looking like a lick, we balling like the nicks. Switch Chicago for that kicks.

Yo Wishy wa wa Wishy wa wa , I'm high just like Sasana , I rush you like Obama. 

I ask her where the bus stop
